# Conway's Game of Life

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C# with wxWidgets for the UI.

## Description

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of rules, creating fascinating patterns.

## Features

- Grid of cells rendered using wxWidgets
- Customizable grid size
- Interactive GUI for viewing the Game of Life board
- Start, pause, next generation, and clear controls
- Pre-defined patterns for setting up initial cell states
- Status bar displaying generation and living cell count

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `Conways-Game-of-Life.sln` solution file using Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the project to launch the application.

4. Use the provided controls to start, pause, advance generations, clear the grid, and set up patterns.

## Requirements Fulfilled

This project meets the following requirements:

- Implements Conway's Game of Life using C# and wxWidgets.
- Provides an interactive GUI for interacting with the simulation.
- Allows the user to start, pause, proceed to the next generation, and clear the grid.
- Offers pre-defined patterns for setting up initial cell states.
- Displays information about the current generation and living cells count.
